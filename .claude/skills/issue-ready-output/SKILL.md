# Issue Ready Output Skill

When creating GitHub issue text, use this structure:

## Title

Short, specific, action-oriented title.

## Background

Explain why this change is needed without assuming the implementer knows previous discussions.

## Goal

Define the desired end state.

## Scope

List what is included and excluded.

## Implementation Notes

Give concrete but not overly prescriptive guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria

Use checkboxes.

## Tests

Specify required tests or explain when manual verification is acceptable.

## Notes

Mention risks, constraints, or follow-up tasks.

For Feature Intelligence issues, also include:

- dependency issue(s) and explicit non-goals from later phases
- deterministic finite-set decisions versus reasoning-model decisions
- no-heuristic-fallback behavior
- required reasoning audit metadata
- target repository and workspace safety boundaries
- DB ownership: only tables required by this issue
